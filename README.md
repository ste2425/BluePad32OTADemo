# BluePad32 BLE Example

This repo contains example code for setting up a Web app and BluePad32 to communicate with each other over BLE.

This can provide the foundation building web apps to perform any verity of tasks, button controller mappings for example.

It can also provide the foundation for performing OTA updates (there will be a different example for this however).

Please see the Readme for the individual components of this example (The Web App and the ESP32 code).
